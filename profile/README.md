### Mylyn provides:
- **The revolutionary task-focused interface**
<br>Realigns the IDE around tasks so that you see only the code that's relevant

Mylyn's [task-focused interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task-focused_interface)
reduces information overload and makes multitasking easy.
Mylyn makes Tasks a first class citizen of the IDE, integrates rich and offline editing for DevOps tools,
monitors your programming activity to create a "task context" that focuses your workspace and automatically links all
relevant artifacts to the task-at-hand. This puts the information you need at your fingertips and improves productivity
by reducing information overload, facilitating multitasking and easing the sharing of expertise.
