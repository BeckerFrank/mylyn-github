### Mylyn provides:
- **The revolutionary task-focused interface**
<br>Realigns the IDE around tasks so that you see only the code that's relevant 
- **A task management tool for developers** 
<br>Averaging 1 million downloads/month, Mylyn is the most popular IDE tool for DevOps 
- **A broad ecosystem of DevOps integrations** 
<br>Use extensions to integrate Mylyn with DevOps tools like Bugzilla, Jenkins, GitHub, JIRA, etc..

Mylyn's [task-focused interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task-focused_interface)
reduces information overload and makes multitasking easy.
Mylyn makes Tasks a first class citizen of the IDE, integrates rich and offline editing for DevOps tools,
monitors your programming activity to create a "task context" that focuses your workspace and automatically links all
relevant artifacts to the task-at-hand. This puts the information you need at your fingertips and improves productivity
by reducing information overload, facilitating multitasking and easing the sharing of expertise.
